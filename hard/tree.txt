Validate  Binary Search Tree: Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Maximum Depth of Binary Tree: Find the maximum depth of a binary tree, which is the longest path from the root to any leaf node.

Lowest Common Ancestor of Binary Tree: Given a binary tree and two nodes, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes.

Binary Tree Level Order Traversal: Traverse a binary tree in level order, i.e., from left to right, level by level.

Invert Binary Tree: Invert a binary tree by swapping the left and right child of each node.

Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree: Serialize a binary tree into a string representation, and then deserialize it back into a tree.

Binary Tree Paths: Find all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree.

Count Complete Tree Nodes: Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Symmetric Tree: Determine if a binary tree is symmetric, i.e., it is a mirror image of itself.

Diameter of Binary Tree: Find the diameter of a binary tree, which is the length of the longest path between any two nodes.
