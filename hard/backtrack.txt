CONCEPTS:--
uses brute force appproach (try out all possible solutions and pick up only desired one) 
used when we want all the available multiple solutions.
represent solution in the form of state space tree.
bounding condition kills the node that is not satisfying the desired condition.
dp---optimisation problem.
backtrack---want all possible solution using dfs
brach and bound ---- uses bfs
