BITWISE-OPERATOR---------------

Bitwise AND of Numbers Range: Given two integers left and right, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in the range [left, right].

Number of 1 Bits: Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has.

Single Number: Given an array of integers where every element appears twice except for one, find that single number.

Bitwise ORs of Subarrays: Given an array of integers, find the number of unique bitwise ORs of all possible subarrays.

Reverse Bits: Reverse the bits of a given 32-bit unsigned integer.

Power of Two: Given an integer, determine if it is a power of two.

Counting Bits: Given a non-negative integer num, for every integer i (0 ≤ i ≤ num), calculate the number of 1 bits in its binary representation.
